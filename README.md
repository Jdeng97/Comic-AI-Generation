# ComicAI Frontend

A simple React + Tailwind CSS web app for generating and previewing AI-created comics.

---

Note:
This version of the project currently uses built-in dummy/mock data inside the code (mockProject() in ComicAIDemo.tsx).
If Mock mode is on, it generates a sample 4-page comic with placeholder images and dialogue for demonstration purposes only.

Once the backend is ready, we can replace the mock functions in ComicAIDemo.tsx (API.createStory, API.startGeneration, and API.pollStatus) with real API calls.
